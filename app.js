// An IIFE, or Immediately Invoked Function Expression, in JavaScript is a function that is defined and executed immediately after its creation. This pattern is commonly used to create a private scope for variables, preventing them from polluting the global scope and enabling more controlled and modular code organization
// function notification()
// {
//   alert("Good Morning. Welcome To My Website");
// }
// notification();

// (function(){
//     alert("Good Morning. Welcome To My Website");
// })();


// arrow function 
 
// let notification = ()=>alert("Good Morning. Welcome To My Website");
// notification();
