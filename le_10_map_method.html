   <h1>Map Method</h1> 
<!-- The map() method in JavaScript is a higher-order function available on Array.prototype. It is used to create a new array by applying a provided callback function to each element of an existing array.  -->
<!-- Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics:
Creates a New Array:
map() does not modify the original array. Instead, it returns a completely new array containing the results of the callback function applied to each element.
Iterates Over Each Element:
It iterates through every element of the array, executing the callback function for each one.
Callback Function:
The map() method takes a callback function as an argument. This function is executed for each element and typically takes three arguments:
currentValue: The current element being processed in the array.
index (optional): The index of the current element.
array (optional): The array map() was called upon.
Return Value of Callback:
The value returned by the callback function for each element becomes an element in the new array.
Non-Mutating:
As mentioned, map() is a non-mutating method, meaning it does not change the original array. This is a crucial distinction from methods like forEach() which can be used to perform side effects on the original array. -->
