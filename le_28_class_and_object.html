    <h1>Javascript Class and Object IN Js</h1>
<!-- In JavaScript, a class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects, encapsulating data (properties) and behavior (methods) into a single, reusable unit. 
Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) as syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.
A class definition is created using the class keyword, followed by the class name. It conventionally begins with a capital letter. Inside the class, you define: 
Constructor:
A special method named constructor() that is automatically called when a new object (instance) of the class is created. It is used to initialize the object's properties. The this keyword within the constructor refers to the newly created instance.
Instance Methods:
Functions defined within the class that provide behavior for objects created from that class. They can access and modify instance properties using this.
Static Methods and Properties (Optional):
Methods and properties defined with the static keyword belong to the class itself, not to individual instances. They are called directly on the class name. -->
